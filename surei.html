    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      Surei Chiya never asked to be watched. He lived alone by design. Quiet by instinct. After quitting university, he drifted between part-time jobs and borrowed cameras, always chasing light he never quite caught.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she showed up. A girl with shadows under her eyes and silence in her mouth. He didn’t mean to stare. Didn’t mean to take her picture. But something about her stuck in the lens—and stuck in him.

    <div class="confession-entry">
      <h3>01. Obsession</h3>
      <p>“I tried to delete her folder. I did. But my hand wouldn’t move. That’s how I knew it wasn’t just fascination anymore. It was survival.”</p>
    </div>

    <div class="confession-entry">
      <h3>02. Heartbreak</h3>
      <p>“She left while I was asleep. Didn’t even close the door all the way. It creaked for days after. I didn’t fix it. I needed the sound.”</p>
    </div>

    <div class="confession-entry">
      <h3>03. Love</h3>
      <p>“She called it obsession. Maybe she was right. But if wanting someone this badly is wrong, then I was never meant for anything soft.”</p>

    <h2>Diary</h2>

    <div class="diary-entry">
      <h3>Entry #07</h3>
      <p>She asked me what I was reading. I lied and said poetry. I was reading her. Every glance. Every pause. Every flinch when I got too close.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="diary-entry">
      <h3>Entry #21</h3>
      <p>There’s a photo of her I never printed. I keep it in a hidden folder. I think if I ever see her again, I’ll show it to her. Or maybe I won’t. Maybe it’s mine now.</p>
