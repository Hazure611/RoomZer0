          <strong>Mctrauma Deluxe</strong><br /><br />
          ‚ú¶ 1 pound heggs from ens female sheken<br />
          This is not "eggs." This is <em>heggs</em>.<br />
          Harvested with permission from an ensouled female sheken (a legally distinct chicken).<br />
          Every hegg contains one traumatic memory.<br /><br />
          ‚ú¶ 2 punched eyedrops lemon flevor<br />
          WHY<br />
          ARE<br />
          THE EYE DROPS<br />
          PUNCHED.<br />
          Also, ‚Äúflevor‚Äù means it burns more than normal. This is how you make the sauce cry back.<br /><br />

          ‚ú¶ 2 buns of buncheeks<br />
          No.<br />
          YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DID.<br />
          These are not sandwich buns.<br />
          These are flesh-adjacent.<br />
          These buns clap when you walk.<br /><br />

          ‚ú¶ A punch and dash of peapor and helylying salt<br />
          You didn‚Äôt mean "pepper" or "Himalayan salt."<br />
          You meant <em>peapor</em> (a spicy lie) and <em>helylying salt</em> ‚Äî which is mined from the shattered promises of a goat exorcism.<br /><br />

          ‚ú¶ 1/2 gince marlic and hives<br />
          Gince marlic.<br />
          That‚Äôs ginger, garlic, and a full mental breakdown in one.<br />
          And hives??? WHY ARE WE SPICY AND ITCHY NOW.<br /><br />

          ‚ú¶ 1/2 chopped honions<br />
          Because your burger needs to smell like regret and onion BO.<br /><br />

          üî™ <strong>PREPARATION:</strong><br />
          Stir in a bowl of grief wearing brief<br />
          The briefs must be tight. The grief must be fresh.<br /><br />
          Take a grain of bruth and stir in some teargass with lemon gass<br />
          This is not seasoning. This is how wars start.<br /><br />

          Need therapy for serving.<br />
          This is a warning label.<br />
          The burger comes with a prescription. Possibly an exorcist.

          ‚ú¶ 1 kl ground pork peenuts<br />
          ‚úÖ Not peanuts. Not even pork. A meat-nut hybrid abomination. It squeals AND crunches.<br /><br />

          ‚ú¶ 2 kls honion reeks<br />
          Not onion rings. Not onions. Just the scent of betrayal, diced into tears.<br /><br />

          ‚ú¶ 5 pice egg milks<br />
          Curdles on eye contact. Illegal in 17 countries.<br /><br />

          ‚ú¶ 4 butter of cartons<br />
          That‚Äôs not a unit. That‚Äôs a threat.<br /><br />

          ‚ú¶ Chopped carrot in screaming version and bloody<br />
          It saw things. It knows too much.<br /><br />

          ‚ú¶ 1/2 liver of cumcumber<br />
          Don‚Äôt ask. Just cook. Or don‚Äôt.<br /><br />

          üî™ Stir while shaking your booty and swirling your tongue on the spatula.<br />
          üí® Dance and fart while frying the cumcumber. Spiritual release is vital.<br /><br />

          DEEPFRU the meat-nuts. This technique is forbidden. Ancient ones weep.

          The fruit. The freak. The forbidden organ.<br /><br />

          This is a crime against bees and measuring.<br /><br />

          ‚ú¶ 1 sore throat of a bee and a butterflu<br />
          For the melancholic aftertaste. And seasonal infection.<br /><br />

          ‚ú¶ 3 punches of salt granulated salted salt<br />
          Salt. Salted. Saltier. You punched it. It deserved it.<br /><br />

          üí® Let your anus gas ferment the jar.<br />
          üôè Pray to the gods that don‚Äôt listen.
