        <p>
          She orders black tea, no sugar. Always. Sits with one foot tucked under her thigh.
          Left hand twitches slightly before touching her cup. She looks up when the bell chimes,
          but never at me. I breathe quieter when she’s within five feet. I can count her exhales
          like seconds on a ticking clock. I wish I was the steam rising from her mug.

        <p>
          I wasn’t trying to hear it. The hallway’s narrow, the pipes creak—but it was her.
          Her voice. Soft, broken, caught between breath and surrender. A moan meant for no one,
          and yet... I couldn’t move. I mouthed her name against the wall, like a prayer. I can’t stop
          hearing it. I don’t want to.

        <p>
          She brushes her hair with her fingers after every fourth sip. Crosses her ankles twice before
          pulling out her phone. Her expression changes when she thinks no one sees her reflection.
          But I do. I always do. I wonder if she knows she’s haunted. I wonder if I’m the ghost.

        <p>
          I drew her again. Her lips first. Always her lips. The pen bleeds too much on this paper,
          just like I do. She left a hair on her chair. I folded it into the sketch and tucked it
          into my sleeve. I’ll press it into my journal later. She doesn’t have to know. She never has to.
