    <h3>"i bit his toothbrush."</h3>
    <div class="user">—Anonymous (userX_fangs32)</div>
    <p>I bit his toothbrush. Every morning. For weeks. He never noticed. Or maybe he did. He always had this way of looking at me sideways—like he was trying not to smile.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="confession-log">
    <h3>"I watched his window for 72 hours straight."</h3>
    <div class="user">—??? (midnightwindow.watcher)</div>
    <p>I lost count of the cigarettes. But not the hours. He touched the blinds at exactly 2:13AM. Every single night. I think it was for me. I think I’m part of his pattern now.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="confession-log">
    <h3>"He dropped a receipt. I framed it."</h3>
    <div class="user">—mossstains</div>
    <p>He ordered yakisoba and an energy drink. I saw the receipt fall. I picked it up before it hit the concrete. It’s in a black frame on my wall. Dated. Signed by fate.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="confession-log">
    <h3>"I called his number. I didn’t speak."</h3>
    <div class="user">—burntviolet</div>
    <p>He answered. Said nothing. I could hear his breathing. Shaky. I was shaking too. But I didn’t hang up. We just… breathed. Together. 67 seconds. Then he whispered: “Don’t stop.”</p>
