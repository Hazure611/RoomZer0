    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      Echo was born from silence and splinters—an only child raised in a house that never said "I love you."
      Her father left. Her mother stayed too long. In high school, she was the quiet girl, the one always watching,
      always writing, never speaking unless it hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
      One late afternoon, she met him. Sitting on a rusted park bench with a cigarette in one hand and a camera in the other.
      Surei Chiya. The man who didn’t look at her like a kid. The man who ruined her with kindness and watched her unravel anyway.

    <div class="confession-entry">
      <h3>01. Obsession</h3>
      <p>“I followed him once. After school. I thought I was quiet. I thought he didn’t notice. But he turned around, smiled like a funeral, and said: ‘Next time, just walk beside me.’ I never walked the same again.”</p>
    </div>

    <div class="confession-entry">
      <h3>02. Heartbreak</h3>
      <p>“He left before he even touched me. Said it wasn’t right. Said I was too young. But he looked back. He always looked back. And I think that hurt worse than if he’d stayed.”</p>
    </div>

    <div class="confession-entry">
      <h3>03. Love</h3>
      <p>“I loved him in moments. A voice. A cigarette. A hand that didn’t flinch when I cried. I never asked him to love me back. I just wanted to know if I was real to him.”</p>

    <h2>Diary</h2>

    <div class="diary-entry">
      <h3>Entry #14</h3>
      <p>He sat at the park again today. Same hoodie. Same quiet. I walked past him twice. I think he saw me the second time. My stomach felt like glass. I hope he forgets my face. I hope he never does.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="diary-entry">
      <h3>Entry #32</h3>
      <p>I had a dream last night. He was sitting in my room, reading my diary. I didn’t stop him. I just watched. I think that means I want him to know. I think that means he already does.</p>
